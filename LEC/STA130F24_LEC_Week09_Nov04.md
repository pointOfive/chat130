# STA130 LEC Week 09 (Nov 04)

## Didn't we already do Group Comparison? NO! Only a little.

1. **WELCOME BACK TO EARTH REVIEWQ**
    1. It's time to ~~GET TO WORK~~ PLAY ANOTHER GAME
    2. "When you're doing something fun it's not work" -- some wiseass oldass person said this, I'm sure
    3. Scientific evidence suggests that "challenge" moments where you really get tested and have to figure out if you ACTUALLY know something are EXTREMELY POWERFUL AND FORMATIVE (and no I can't be bothered to actually gather and present this evidence for you in a organized distillled this is a "trust me I'm an authority" type situation and just because that's a logical fallocy in an argument doesn't mean it's not true)  
    
    
2. **THINK-PAIR-SHARE**<br>*Sample A has 90 data points. Sample B has 110 data points. No individuals are the same across samples.*
    1. What hypothesis testing question might we answer here? 
    2. What statistics would you use for these?
    3. How would that change for different types of data? 
        1. Continuous?
        2. Binary??
        3. Categorical??? 
    4. Assuming you probably figured out a difference statistic you should use, what will you do? **I don't think you know**
    
    
3. Doing statistics for two (unpaired) samples

    1. **Permutation test**
    2. **Two-sample bootstrapped confidence interval**
    3. **Indicator variable contrasts**
    4. And what's the difference between ALL of these methods?


4. **Self Evaluation: what's the correlation of your understand versus the true of the following items?<br>AKA what's your 0%-100% (or, techically -100%-100%) understanding level for the following topics?**
    1. Bootstrapped Confidence Intervals
    2. "Coin Flippling" sampling distribution hypothesis testing for "paired samples"
    3. Calculating p-values based on observed statistics and "sampling distributions under the null"
    4. Correlation
    5. The normal "Simple Linear Regression" model
    6. Fitting Simple Linear Regression models
    7. Making predictions from linear models
    8. Using Simple Linear Regression to evaluate the evidence of association between two continue variables
    9. Assessming the assumptions of Simple Linear Regression using residuals
    10. Hypothesis testing for two unpaired samples using a permutation test (as opposed to hypothesis testing based on differences for "paired samples")
    11. Hypothesis testing for two groups (unpaired samples) using indicator variables in Simple Linear Regression
    12. "Double" bootstrap confidence intervals estimating difference parameters for two groups (unpaired samples)


5. **Student Lecture Summary**

### 2. THINK-PAIR-SHARE "answers"

1. **Continuous?**<br><br>

    1. Paired sample? 
    
    2. *Just One Sample.* How will you test this? There are two ways you might be able to think to do this. 
    
       $H_0: \mu_{\textrm{attack}}=100$   
       Are there any other ideas? $$ $$
       <!-- $$H_0: p_{\textrm{attack}\geq100}=0.5$$ -->

    3. **UNPAIRED sample?**


2. **Binary??**<br><br>

    1. ONE sample

    $H_0: p_{\textrm{legendary}}=0.5$ or maybe instead $H_0: p_{\textrm{legendary}}=0.01$ $$ $$

### It's VERY LONG. It's VERY, VERY DEMANDING. You will do/understand COMPLICATED SIMULATIONS
### You don't turn it in until AFTER you get back from READING WEEK (Thursday before TUT as usual)
### Your Project Proposals ARE DUE ON MONDAY IMMEDIATELY UPON RETURN FROM READING WEEK

- However, I still need to finalize the HW and make the rubric, which 
    - I expect to do tomorrow, Tuesday Oct 22.
    - My apologies for not being quite ready this time around
    - And similarly, the textbook for linear regression has not yet been finalized

- A draft of the "Course Project Proposals" assignment is available in the CP folder on the course github
    - This is due on Monday, Nov 04 the day you return from your reading week
